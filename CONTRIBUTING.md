# Contributing

Feel free to contribute to Qaike. I would love any work you put into it. 

The first three contributors will get their username in the README under "first contributors" you have the option to opt out of this, just tell me that in a comment for your PR.

## How to Contribute

Open a pull request with your updates. Keep your update a reasonable size if you use a branch, or use a fork for larger updates. 

## Opening an Issue

Please open an isssue in Github if you ever need any help using the code or if you come across some bug or code improvement.
