# Qaike
A simple bot to play a dice game called QWIXX.

## Running
To use, you can run the file called QaikeAI_1.py with a Python interpreter.

You can also use an online python interpreter. I recommend relpit.com or Binder

### Running with Replit
If you want to run the code using replit.com, navigate to this link https://replit.com/@mteam888/Qaike?v=1
and click run.

### Running with Binder
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mteam88/Qaike/main)

You can also run the code using Binder:https://mybinder.org/. Click the above badge to clone than use `%run QaikeAI_1.py` in a new notebook to run.
To create a new notebook, click new in the top right, and then select "Python 3." If this doesn't work, open a new terminal through the same menu and run: `python3 QaikeAI_1.py`
