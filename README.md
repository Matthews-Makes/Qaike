A simple bot to play a dice game called QWIXX.

## Running
To use, you can run the file called QaikeAI_1.py with a Python interpreter.

You can also use an online python interpreter. I recommend relpit.com or Binder

### Running with Gitpod
Navigate to https://gitpod.io/#github.com/Matthews-Makes/Qaike and fullsize the "terminal" to play.

### Running with Replit
If you want to run the code using replit.com, navigate to this link https://replit.com/@mteam888/Qaike?v=1
and click run.

### Running with Binder
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/matthews-makes/Qaike/main)

You can also run the code using Binder:https://mybinder.org/. Click the above badge to clone than use `%run QaikeAI_1.py` in a new notebook to run.
To create a new notebook, click new in the top right, and then select "Python 3." If this doesn't work, open a new terminal through the same menu and run: `python3 QaikeAI_1.py`

## Issues
If you have any problems, please open an issue on github.


## Documentation
Using the AI is simple, and there is an embedded help text.

A "QLog.txt" file is created when you finish a game. You can check this to see past games and see how the AI performed.
