# Qaike
A simple bot to play a dice game called QWIXX.

To use, you can run the file called QaikeAI_1.py with a Python interpreter.

You can also use an online python interpreter. I recommend relpit.com or
	the online spyder trial.

If you want to run the code using replit.com, navigate to this link https://replit.com/@mteam888/Qaike?v=1
and click run.

I would also recommend using binder:https://mybinder.org/, and cloning the Qaike repo. After you do that, you can run the code in a notebook with the command "%run QaikeAI_1.py"

If you have any problems, please open an issue on github.
